You are given a number N. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive).

Example 1:

Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
For numbers from 1 to 4.
For 1: 0 0 1 = 1 set bits
For 2: 0 1 0 = 1 set bits
For 3: 0 1 1 = 2 set bits
For 4: 1 0 0 = 1 set bits
Therefore, the total set bits is 5.
Example 2:

Input: N = 17
Output: 35
Explanation: From numbers 1 to 17(both inclusive), 
the total number of set bits is 35.

Your Task: The task is to complete the function countSetBits() that takes n as a parameter and returns the count of all bits.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 108"""
