"""The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state.
Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of
statements(i.e. instructions) that are eiecuted at the time of Object creation.
It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
The method is useful to do anj initialization jou want to do with jour object.
